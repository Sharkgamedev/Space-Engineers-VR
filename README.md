# THERE IS ANOTHER SPACE ENGINEERS VR MOD CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT THAT IS MUCH FARTHER ALONG THAN THIS, SO I WILL BE CEASING WORK ON THIS. KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR IT THOUGH! ;)

# Space Engineers VR MOD

### NOTICE!
This VR Mod is an early Wip. You probably shouldn't but *might* have some crashes (If you do I'd love it if you created an issue using the tabs above, attaching your log file!) but more importantly *things will be jank* and *not all features are in yet.* Things will improve with time however!

### What's this?
This is a full vr mod for Space Engineers, it features:
- Full 6 DOF
- Motion controls for weapons/tools and placing blocks
- Multiplayer (Needs more testing)

### How do I download/install it?
First you'll need to subscribe to the (Space Engineers Plugin Loader)[https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2407984968] on the steam workshop.  
Once that's done make sure you add ``-plugin "..\..\..\workshop\content\244850\2407984968\RunPluginLoader"`` to your Space Engineers launch options in steam by right clicking the game in your library->properties->paste that into the launch options.  
Now launch the game, you should see a plugins button in the menu, if not retrace your steps.  
Click plugins and in the menu search for ``Space-Engineers-VR`` then hit the checkbox to enable it and when prmopted, restart Space Engineers.  
Now connect your headset, launch SteamVR now or let the game do it for you, pick a world and load into it. Have fun!
