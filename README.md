### How do I download/install it?
First you'll need to subscribe to the (Space Engineers Plugin Loader)[https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2407984968] on the steam workshop.  
Once that's done make sure you add ``-plugin "..\..\..\workshop\content\244850\2407984968\RunPluginLoader"`` to your Space Engineers launch options in steam by right clicking the game in your library->properties->paste that into the launch options.  
Now launch the game, you should see a plugins button in the menu, if not retrace your steps.  
Click plugins and in the menu search for ``SE VR`` then hit the checkbox to enable it and when prmopted, restart Space Engineers.  
Now connect your headset, launch SteamVR now or let the game do it for you, pick a world and load into it. Have fun!
